# DQSN Documentation Index

## Start here (Shield Contract v3 — authoritative)

- **Contract (binding):** `CONTRACT.md`
- **Architecture (role + flow):** `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Upgrade plan (work log + invariants):** `DQSN_V3_UPGRADE_PLAN.md`

These three documents define the v3 truth of DQSN. Reviews should focus here.

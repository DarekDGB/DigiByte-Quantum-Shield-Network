# DigiByte Quantum Shield Network — Shield v3.2.0 Release Status

Author attribution: DarekDGB

## Status

Shield v3.2.0 is the manifest / verdict / receipt lock release.

This repository is ready for the `v3.2.0` Shield-side tag only after:

- GitHub Actions are green
- coverage gate remains satisfied
- v3.2.0 manifest docs are present
- reason ID registry is present
- evidence-family registry is present
- test matrix is present
- proof pack is present
- docs match tests
- final fresh ZIP audit is complete
- authorized Red Team / bypass review is complete
- no unresolved critical or high findings remain

## Release Scope

This release locks the Shield v3.2.0 integration boundary for this component.

It includes:

- deterministic manifest discipline
- stable reason ID registry
- stable evidence-family registry
- canonical component verdict lock
- fail-closed validation expectations
- Orchestrator-first AdamantineOS handoff language

## Authority Boundary

This component does not sign, broadcast, hold keys, modify DigiByte consensus, expand authority, override the Shield Orchestrator, or approve AdamantineOS execution directly.

Component output is evidence only.

AdamantineOS must consume Shield only through the deterministic Shield Orchestrator receipt.

Shield `ALLOW` is not final AdamantineOS signing or execution authority.

## Red Team / Bypass Review

Final review scope included:

- component bypass
- unknown registry values
- duplicate / missing evidence
- context-hash mismatch
- receipt tampering where applicable
- AI authority bypass
- governance approval reuse at current scope
- replay / freshness boundary at current Shield scope
- docs-vs-tests alignment

Result: no unresolved critical or high findings remain for Shield v3.2.0 tagging.

## AdamantineOS Tag Boundary

AdamantineOS is not tagged as part of Shield v3.2.0.

AdamantineOS remains on its own release line:

```text
v2.2.0 — WSQK v2 Quantum-Aware Upgrade
```

AdamantineOS must not be tagged until Shield v3 is fully integrated into AdamantineOS and the Adamantine release checklist passes.

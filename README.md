**Shield Contract v3 • Deterministic Aggregation • Fail-Closed Security**

DQSN is the **network-level aggregation layer** of the DigiByte Quantum Shield.
It consumes **read-only Shield Contract v3 signals**, validates and deduplicates them,
and emits a **deterministic v3 response** for downstream decision layers.

> DQSN aggregates signals.  
> Higher layers decide and act.

## 📌 Status

- **Version:** v3.0.0 / Shield Contract v3
- **CI:** ✅ Passing
- **Coverage:** 100% full `dqsnetwork` package coverage enforced
- **State:** v3.0.0 stabilised and ready for Shield Orchestrator integration

This repository contains the **authoritative DQSN v3 implementation**. The `v3.0.0` stabilisation release locks deterministic aggregation, fail-closed validation, typed package metadata, and full-package coverage enforcement.

## 🧭 Role in the Quantum Shield

    S[Sentinel AI v3] --> D[DQSN v3]
    A[ADN v3] --> D
    D --> G[Guardian Wallet / QWG]
    G --> C[User / Policy / Orchestrator]
```

DQSN sits **between sensors and decision layers**.
It never executes actions and never mutates state.

## 🧱 Architectural Guarantees

DQSN v3 guarantees:

- strict schema validation (deny unknown keys)
- fail-closed behavior on ambiguity
- deterministic output and hashing
- stable reason codes
- no timestamps, randomness, or side effects

If input is invalid, output is **deterministically ERROR**.

## 🗂 Repository Layout

```
dqsnetwork/
├─ v3.py                  # canonical aggregation entrypoint
├─ contracts/             # Shield Contract v3 definitions

│  ├─ v3_hash.py
│  └─ v3_reason_codes.py

└─ ...

└─ historical prototypes (non-authoritative)

└─ authoritative documentation
```

Only code under `dqsnetwork/` is authoritative for v3 behavior.

## 🔐 Determinism Model

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Upstream
    participant D as DQSN v3
    participant X as Downstream

    U->>D: Shield v3 signals
    D->>D: validate + dedup + aggregate
    D->>X: deterministic v3 response
```

Identical input → identical output. Always.

## 📚 Documentation

Start here:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — design and authority boundaries
- `docs/INDEX.md` — documentation map
- `docs/DQSN_V3_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` — completed upgrade record

---

## ⚠️ Authority Rule

If documentation and code disagree,  
**the code in `dqsnetwork/` wins.**
